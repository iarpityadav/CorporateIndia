			<h4>2015</h4>
			<h1>Happy new year ahead</h1>
		   <p>
			 Global economic growth is expected to be 3.6 per cent in 2015, mainly due to the rapid growth in the US. However, Europe is falling back. It urgently requires reforms since its
			 economy is stagnating, investments are lagging behind announcements and growth is far too weak. Europe is at risk of losing further competition ground not only to the US but also to Asia.

			 US equities as well as Asian emerging market stocks including Indian stocks will benefit from the expected global economic recovery and stable corporate earnings. Companies’
			 market values will also increase in 2015. By the end of 2015, we see the SENSEX at 35,000. The key points for Indian story are: growth is expected to accelerate further with declining
			 inflation and Narendra Modi who has raised high expectations will have to streamline the delivery mechanism in the coming months. Stock markets have tremendous upside, while
			 bonds may find support from the expected rate cuts in 2015.
			 With widespread expectations of lower interest rates, equities seem interesting and promising for long-term investors; but there is hardly any positive return possible without
			 risk in the foreseeable future. Gold, however, seems uninteresting as an investment in 2015. The US upswing is self-supporting. This is a good sign for the global economy. With an
			 expected growth of 3.5 percent in the USA next year, the unemployment rate is expected to decrease towards 5 percent. The low-priced domestic shale oil provides an additional lubricant
			 for the US economy. Furthermore, corporate earnings have increased significantly and are growing robustly.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			 Since the middle of 2014, the US dollar has already appreciated significantly against the important currencies in the world. 2014 was only the beginning. The appreciation of the
			 dollar is expected to continue, due to increasing capital flows into US bonds and equities from the low interest rate regions Europe and Japan.
			 It is interesting to note that India has turned into an Investor Darling from Castaway Market in the last one year. Modi’s regime has set in motion a virtuous cycle in terms of
			 business confidence, receding inflation, deficit reduction, economic growth, attention on stabilizing currency and increase in inbound investment. Curbed government spending,
			 small changes that make it easier to do business and revival of stalled investment projects are some of the key drivers that will accelerate the economic and capital markets growth.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			 Most importantly inflation is coming down, while expectations on GDP growth are rising to the level between 6.5 per cent and 7 per cent in 2015. GDP growth is expected to be beyond
			 7 per cent in 2016 driven by implementation of half-finished capital intensive projects. Expected risks in 2015 are a re-run of 2013 blood bath in emerging markets in anticipa-
			 tion of a US rate hike. However, India is better placed to whether the storm now than earlier, though the country is dependent on external funding.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			 There is room for rate cut in the first half of 2015 as inflation is fast edging towards RBI’s target. With more inflows expected, the rupee is likely to stabilize against the dollar. Amidst
			 cautious approach followed by monetary authorities worldwide, the RBI may cap the rate cut at about 50 basis points. Equity valuations in India are quite reasonable. Earnings momentum is expected to take off
			 and domestic investors may also start buying aggressively in the new year. So the BSE Sensex has good upside in 2015 and in the next 2 years. There may be corrections of 5 per cent on either side,
			 but these will be short lived. Mid cap and small caps are the ones to be looked at in 2015.
