					 potential customers (leads) totaling to 37,395 against 26,142 in June 2014 quarter. According to Mr. Saboo, the company has 42 stores across the country, compared with 41 last year.
				 </p>	<br/> 
				 <p class="kddl-detail">	 
					 Titan and Times are company’s principal vendors in India. All its customers are big brands and are doing well domestically and internationally. As it has confidentiality agreement, it cannot disclose the names of its international customers. The company has presence in metros
					 and Tier I and Tier II cities. Before setting up stores it looks for reputed/pedigree mall at premium location where other premium brands are present and having better
					 facility management. It has seven airport stores in dutyfree zone and domestic terminal at Bangalore, Delhi, Mumbai and Ahmadabad. However, the company has to share
					 around 20-25 per cent of sales with the airports.
				 </p><br/>
				 <p class="kddl-detail">
					 Thus what is saved in duty is given away as profit sharing to airports. The company has precision stamping division named Eigen. This division offers high precision press component
					 and tooling solution and wide range of engineering applications. The management thinks that this business will grow at a fast rate going forward.
					 Referring to the demand situation, Mr. Saboo maintains that domestic market is looking up but international markets are sluggish due to geo-political issues in many
					 countries across the world. The company is growing faster than its competitors. It manages more sales at discountssmaller than those given by the competition.
					 <br/><br/>
					 The company
					 has loyalty, referral and rewards points programmes for its customers. This helps it retain customers and get new leadsfrom them. Ethos, 73 per cent subsidiary of KDDL, is India’s largest retail chain of luxury watch studios and an authorized retailer
					 of over 60 luxury watch brands. The company opened “WSI” by Ethos Store in Trillium Mall, Amritsar in May and in Inorbit Mall, Vadodara in July. It closed Ethos store in Bangalore,
					 Bhopal, Hyderabad and Pune. The company will look at equity expansion again in the next 1-2 years tofund Ethos. But it must be noted that foreign funds cannot invest in Ethos as currently FII investments are not allowed in multi-brand stores
					 and the company is a multi-brand retailer.

							 “The management is highly bullish on solar pumps. We see huge opportunities in this market. This will brighten the outlook for the company in the coming years”, maintains Mr. Dinesh Patidar, Chairman and Managing Director of Shakti Pumps (India). Reviewing the disappointing performance of the company
						  	 in the quarter ended September 2014, Mr. Patidar says that sales fell 27 per cent to Rs. 55.71 crore and the net profit was down 44 per cent to Rs. 3.35 crore. The sales were affected by setback suffered in the exports business. Exports to Iraq which accounts for nearly 40 per cent of the company’s total exports
							 dropped from Rs. 14 crore to nil.  The company had projected exports of Rs. 65 crore in the September 2014 quarter but could manage only Rs. 35 crore. Of course, the company has
							 orders from Iraq but is not servicing those orders as it is not very confident of getting the money. The company used to export two containers worth Rs. 5-7 crore every month to Iraq but has stopped it now. Problems in the West Asia are temporary as the company foresees constant demand for water from
							 the geographies like Iraq, Syria and Libya.”
						 </p>
						 <p align="left"><img src="<?php echo $baseUrl; ?>images/captainspeak2.jpg" class="img-responsive" align="right"/> 
							 According to him, revenues were also hit as some sales were shifted to the December quarter 2014 quarter due to extended rains and elections. The company is now working in new geographies to shore up its exports especially to
							 Africa, Europe and USA. For the December 2014 quarter, the company expects sales to be around 90 crore, out of which Rs. 35 crore is expected to come from the exports and Rs. 55 crore from the domestic markets. “For the March 2015 quarter, we expect sales to be around Rs. 115 crore. If there is any recovery from Iraq,
							 Syria and Libya markets, it will be added to this guidance as the company has not factored in sales of a single penny from these geographies,” he says. “The management did not know that pledging of promoters’ shares adversely affects the image of the company”, Mr.Patidar says and adds that having to come to know, the 
							 promoters have started de-pledging their shares. By now the pledged shares have come down from 78 per cent to 54 per cent and the promoters will continue to de-pledge more.
						 </p>
						 
						  <p align="left">
						     Mr. Patidar reveals that NABARD has come out with orders for 60,000 pumps which will be distributed among 19 channel partners. Out of these, 17
							 channel partners use pumps made by Shakti Pumps. Each pumps costs around Rs. 35,000; sothere is a potential order of Rs. 210 crore.Pointing out that most Governments are insisting on
							 the use of Star-rated pumps wherever they are subsidisingtheir purchase on account of higher energy efficiency”, Mr.Patidar adds that BEE estimated agriculture accounts for
							 about 27 per cent of electricity consumption in the country,which is increasing due to rural electrification efforts of the Government. The electricity is largely used in agricultural
							 pump sets which generally have poor efficiency. Most of the pilot projects as well as other studies project potential power saving of 40-50 per cent merely by replacing inefficient
							 pumps. Overall electricity saving (from 20 million pumps) is estimated at 62.1 billion units annually. This is estimated to translate into the yearly savings of Rs. 1800
							 crore”.
						 </p>
						 <p align="left">
							 Referring to the 15% compulsory convertible preference shares (CCPS) issue, he says that the company’s board allotted 15 lakh CCPS at a nominal
							 value of Rs. 100 each at a premium of Rs. 200 each aggregating to Rs. 45 crore and convertible into 1.64 million equity shares of Rs 10 each at a premium of Rs. 265 each of the company at a conversion
							 ratio of 1:1.0909 to Global Environment Fund (GEF) through its arm AF Holdings, a Company incorporated under the laws of Mauritius. Through this investment the company
							 hopes to get new dealers and clients in US and European markets. Global Environment Fund invests only in companies which have environment-friendly products and are unlisted.
							 Shakti Pumps is the only listed company where it has invested.
						 </p>
						 <ul align="left"><b>Other points made by Mr. Patidar:</b>
							 <li>
								  It achieved sales of Rs. 3 crore from USA. It has just started focusing on the US market.
							 </li>
							 <li>
								 The company is working at capacity utilization of 60-70 per cent and there is no capacity expansion plans in the near future.

					 <button type="button" class="collapsible3"><h4 align="left"> <span id="ongc1">ONGC</span><span id="crude">Crude price drop eats into gas price hike gains</span></h4></button>
					 <div class="content3">
						 <p align="left">
							 “The falling trend is global crude oil prices threatens to eat into the gains from the hike in the domestic gas price”, maintains Mr. D K Saraf, Chairman and Managing Director of ONGC.
						 </p>
						 <p align="left"><img src="<?php echo $baseUrl; ?>images/captainspeak4.jpg" class="img-responsive" align="right"/> 
							 According to Mr. Saraf, the government raised the price of locally produced natural gas from $4.2 per million metric British thermal units (mmBtu) to $5.6 with effect from 1 November,
							 a move that helped ONGC, which has faced soaring production costs in the last five years while prices remained flat. For every one dollar rise in natural gas price, ONGC’s annual net revenue increases by Rs. 4000 crore and net profit
							 by Rs. 2300 crore. Therefore, for the remaining five months of the fiscal year (as gas price was hiked only from November), ONGC’s net revenue and profit could have gone up by around
							 Rs. 2300 crore and Rs. 1300 crore, respectively. However, this has turned out to be a mirage as the falling crude oil prices have dealt a blow to the company’s finances.
						 </p>
						 
						  <p align="left">
						     Adds Mr. A K Banerjee, director of finance at ONGC, “every one dollar per barrel drop in crude price trims annual net revenue by roughly Rs. 800 crore and net profit by Rs.
							 450-475 crore.” Therefore, considering that the average crude price has dropped by nearly $3 per barrel in the current fiscal as compared with that of last fiscal, there could be an overall
							 standalone impact of Rs. 2400 crore on revenue and Rs. 1350 crore on net profit. If crude price continues to fall, things could get worse. The price of the Indian crude basket averaged
							 $105 per barrel in the last fiscal year. This fiscal, however, it has averaged around $102 and is still falling. Maintaining that “the relationship of falling crude price
							 and rising gas price is not completely linear in India”, Mr. Saraf adds that the net realization per barrel is capped due to the subsidy burden borne by upstream companies such
							 as ONGC, Oil India Ltd and Gail (India) Ltd. “Last year, ONGC’s net realization (net profit on sale of crude oil) was capped at $40.9 per barrel approximately due to the impact
							 of the subsidy burden. If crude prices stay low, then the subsidy burden also comes down and that could mean a higher net realization for ONGC.” he said.
													 </p>
						 <p align="left">
							 Elaborating the new gas price determination policy, Mr. Banerjee points out that the periodicity of price determination/notification
							 shall be half yearly. The price and volume data used for calculation of applicable price shall be the trailing four quarter data with one quarter lag.  The first price
							 would be determined on the basis of price prevailing between 1st July, 2013 and 30th June, 2014.  This pricewould come into effect from 1st November, 2014 and would
							 be valid till 31st March, 2015.  Thereafter, it would be revised for the period 1st April, 2015 to 30th September, 2015 on the basis of prices prevalent between 1st January,
							 2014 and 31st December, 2014, i.e., with the lag of a quarter and so on.  The prices would be announced 15 days in advance of the half year, for which it is applicable.
						 </p>
						 <p align="left">
							 The revised gas price so determined would be applicable to all gas produced from nomination fields given to ONGC and OIL India, NELP
							 blocks, such Pre-NELP blocks where PSC provides for Government approval of gas prices and CBM blocks. The following are the exceptions to which this policy would not
							 apply: (a) Small and isolated fields in nomination blocks. Given their peculiar conditions, guidelines for pricing of their gas issued in 2013 would continue to apply. (b) Where prices have been fixed contractuallyfor a certain period of time, till the end
							 of such period. (c) Where the PSC provides a specific formula for natural gas price indexation/fixation (d) Such PreNELP blocks where Government approval has not been
							 provided for under the Production Sharing Contract (PSC). The matter relating to cost recovery on account of shortfall in envisaged production from D1, D3 discoveries of
							 Block KG-DWN-98-3 is under arbitration. Hence the operator would be paid the earlier price of $4.2/MMBTU till the shortfall quantity of gas is made good.  It is proposed that
							 the difference between the revised price and the present price (US $ 4.2 per million BTU) would be credited to the gas pool account maintained by GAIL and whether the
							 amount so collected is payable or not to the contractors of this Block would depend on the arbitration award and any attendant legal proceedings. For all discoveries in Ultra Deep Water Areas, Deep Water Areas and High Pressure-High
							 Temperature areas after this decision, a premium would be given on the gas price.
						 </p>
					 <p align="left">
						 In the NER region, the 40 per cent subsidy would continue to be available for gas supplied by ONGC/OIL. However, as private operators are also likely to start
						 production of gas in NER and would be operating in the same market, this subsidy should also be available to them to incentivize exploration and production. ONGC believes that an increase in natural 
						 gas price would lead to faster explorations in India. It expects crude oil prices to be robust over longer term period. However, there could be aberrations to this for shorter periods.

							 Maintaining that Oil India would like to be The fastest growing Energy Company with Global presence, providing value to stakeholders.  Mr.
							 Sunil Kumar Shrivastava, Chairman adds “the company’s focus remains on its core competence of Exploration and Production of hydrocarbons. 
						 </p>
						 <p align="left"><img src="<?php echo $baseUrl; ?>images/captainspeak3.jpg" class="img-responsive" align="right"/> 
							 The key focus areas for growth of the company would broadly
							 cover (a) Continue to induct world class technology (b) Focus on organic growth (c) Develop fields with potential for quick monetization (d)  Acquire blocks to augment existing reserve
							 base (e) Acquisition of companies that are value accretive and (f) Diversify through downstream investments.Pointing out that “at present OIL’s hydrocarbon production primarily
							 comes from its matured fields in the North East and our biggest priority is to sustain and increase production from these matured fields,” Mr. Shrivastava adds “this
							 needs induction of state-of-the-art and fit for purpose technology, increased drilling and fast tracking plans to explore newer and prospective areas. The company has adopted strategy of balanced
							 growth of portfolio of assets by continuing to acquire exploration acreage, discovered blocks, producing properties domestically and internationally. In order to ensure
							 competitiveness vis-à-vis industry players, Oil has undertaken an initiative for formulation of Perspective Plan 2030 to build strategies, and, based on these strategies, restructure the
							 organisation for performance excellence by streamlining the business process and practices. The exercise will be starting very soon.”
						 </p>
						 
						  <p align="left">
						     Referring to exploration and production, he says that “the company’s  core business is exploration and production of hydrocarbons and our focus will be to accelerate our
							 exploration, development and production activities. The company continues to step up seismic survey activities, augment exploratory, delineation and development drilling.
							 High-tech interventions through improved oil recovery (IOR) and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) schemes, and, optimal reservoir management in the existing mature fields
							 remains the top priority. The company is actively pursuing planned exploration activities in all the NELP and other blocks spread throughout the country in a time bound manner
							 for completion of Minimum Work Programme as scheduled. Exploratory drilling has commenced in both KG Basin
							 and Mizoram blocks where Oil India is the operator.
						 </p>
						 <p align="left">
							 “Revealing that the company has achieved natural gas production of 2626 MMSCM from Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Rajasthan fields during the year 2014, Mr.
							 Shrivastava asserts that “the achievement is more significant in view of the frequent disruptions in field  activities due to local problems, Sunil Kumar Shrivastava
							 gas evacuation problem from Baghjan, a prolific producing field and low upliftment by our sole customer at Rajasthan. The present gas production potential is about 7.35
							 MMSCMD from our Assam and Arunachal Pradesh fields and about 0.70 MMSCMD from the Rajasthan fields. Action is at hand to increase the gas production potential to a level
							 of 1 MMSCMD in the North East by drilling of non-associated gas wells and workover of shut-in gas wells and adoption of the new well completion technology. Shale/nonconventional
							 gas has emerged as an area of interest. Shale Gas Policy is being formulated by the Government of India and as and when the bidding rounds are announced the company will actively
							 participate in the same. The Government of India has granted permission to OIL for exploration and exploitation of Shale Oil & Gas in five nomination acreages of which four are in Assam
							 and one in Rajasthan. We also continue to pursue Shale Oil/Gas opportunities in India and Abroad. The company also has one CBM block in partnership with M/s Dart Energy Ltd, who
							 is the operator. Work is in progress in the block as per work programme. LNG is another area where the company is actively trying to enter into. We are studying a few opportunitiesto
							 make an entry in this segment of the gas business.”
						 </p>
						 <p align="left">
							 Giving information about the company’s overseas participation, Mr. Shrivastava points out that “OIL’s overseas E & P portfolio comprises of 16 blocks and are spread over
							 10 countries covering Libya, Gabon, Nigeria, Yemen, Venezuela, USA, Mozambique, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Russia. In addition, OIL has 10% PI in a product pipeline in
							 Sudan. In Libya the company is in the process of relinquishing the blocks no 86 and 102/4 where no commercial discovery was made. In Area 95/96 where OIL holds 25%
							 Participating Interest (PI) and Sonatrach is the operator, five wells have been drilled and substantial oil & gas have been discovered during testing.
