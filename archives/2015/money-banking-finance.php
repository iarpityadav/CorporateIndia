			 Ka Finsec Services Pvt. Ltd., one of India’s leading financial consultancy companies enjoying reputation of a consultant and planned investment advisor
			 for the last 8 years, has devised a unique real estate investment scheme styled as ‘Project Jai Ho’, for online investment in residential plot. The scheme is a brainchild of the far-sighted Mr. Amit Mehta, the promoter
			 and chairman and managing director of Ka Finsec. He has experience of 25 years in banking as well as financial markets. Entering the stock market at the young age of 18 in 1991 in the heady days of Harshad Mehta, he, for
			 several years acted as a financial sector broker before changing tracks eight years ago to offer consultancy and broking services for a wide range of financial
			 products as also real estate. “The experience and expertise of the pro moter, officers and advisors serve the customers well and assist them in deriving maximum
			 returns from their investment,” maintains Mr. Mehta. He adds, “I wish to make this investment consultancy a fee-based profession on the line of chartered accountancy.”

			 Leveraging its organizational and intellectual resources, Ka Finsec offers wealth management services to help its clients invest in a diversified set of assets including equities, debt
			 securities, structured products, real estate investments, commodities, mutual funds and insurance. “Our dedicated wealth managers provide specially designed products for corporate,

			 The first two are saddled with uncertainties and possibilities of capital loss; real estate is the only sure shot. But the real estate sector is unorganized and dominated
		 	 by cash transactions. The common man is confused about the trustworthiness of the real estate market operators. We wish to take the benefits of real estate investment
			 to ordinary people through an organized, systematic and lawful win-win plan. For the first time in India we have introduced the concept of research-based investment through a unique
			 selling structure on profit sharing basis with minimum guaranteed returns of 18 per cent. It has been tried successfully in UAE and US. It plans to have a credit rating from agency like CRISIL in
			 due course of time followed by an IPO in the next two to three years.

			 The company has devised a unique scheme for investment in real estate styled as ‘Project Jai Ho’ for online investment in residential plot. The scheme, first of its kind in the country offers minimum
			 assured return of 18 per cent. Holding period under the scheme will be 6 years and the company also promises to buy back the plot if the plot owner is not ready to hold the plot for six years.
			 According to Mr. Mehta, “there are three different plans for investment in land under this scheme - full payment, money back plan, one-time investment plan with discount
			 and instalment plan. Investment under this scheme is totally legal, transparent and safe.”

			 Maintaining that “people are generally wary about investment in real estate because of various intricacies involved in the business” Mr. Mehta adds that “our scheme is totally
		 	 transparent, and involves 100 per cent cheque payment. At the same time, investors are being given a legal document on a Rs. 100 stamp paper with notary agreement. What is
		 	 more, the ownership is very clear and there are no uncertainties and ambiguities.”Ka Finsec offers stock broking services in equity and derivatives, both online and offline, to retail as well as institutional
			 investors.
