			 <h1>“Surat is all set to be a Smart City”</h1>
			 <h4>“Our vision is to make Surat the Most Livable City in the country over the next ten years.”</h4>
			 <p>“Surat is likely to be the first to emerge as a Smart City in the country, out of the 100 envisioned by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Surat Municipal Corporation has
				 tied up with technology giant Microsoft to introduce innovative online solutions in civic services and make them more responsive, efficient and people-centric. In another major ini-
				 tiative for the city, the Gujarat government will sign an MoU with the Indian Railways for modernization and upgradation of Surat stationat the upcoming Vibrant Gujarat summit,”
				 says Mr. Niranjan Zanzmera, Mayor of Surat
			</p>
		  <p align="left"><img src="<?php echo $baseUrl;?>images/special2.png" class="img-responsive" id="special2" align="right"/>
			 In an extended meeting with Corporate India, Mr.Zanzmera a young and dynamic tax consultant and social worker associated with numerous organizations, spoke at
			 length about the spectacular development seen by the city over the last decade and his plans for making Surat the Most Livable City in the country over the next ten years.
			 “The real transformation of Surat started in the late half of 1990s. The plague of 1994, a tragic event in itself, proved to be a boon in disguise. By temporarily isolating the city from the rest of
			 the country, it paved the way for sustained long term civic initiatives to make Surat one of the most livable, well-planned city providing civic services to its inhabitants,” says Mr.
			 Zanzmera. According to him,“if you compare today’s Surat with what it was in 1996, the transformation would become obvious. In 1996, the area of Surat Municipal
			 Corporation was 112 sq km, today it is  326 sq km. The SMC had a budget of Rs. 268 crore then; now it has crossed Rs. 4100 crore. Back then, the city had less
			 than 10 bridges and no flyovers; today there are around 60 of them and 35-40 are either under construction or in the pipeline to serve its bulging population
			 of nearly 50 lakh. Till 1996, Surat had less than 4 lakh vehicles; now there are around two millions of them, almost twice the number of households in the city.”

		   </p>
		   <p align="left"><img src="<?php echo $baseUrl;?>images/special3.png" class="img-responsive" id="special3" align="right"/>
			 Governance of such a city is an awesome task, even for the best administrators. Maintains Mr. Milind Torawane, Municipal Commissioner, Surat “our primary objective is to provide basic
			 civic amenities to the growing population of the city. These include Potable water supply, Underground sewage system in the whole city, all weather roads, Efficient and sustainable solid
			 waste management, Health coverage to all especially for the poor, Primary education to the needy and library facility to all, upgradation of the amenities in the existing slums and alternative
			 accommodation, Clean and green and pollution free environment, Places of healthy entertainment and recreation, fire service and efficient urban planning and development.”
			 “Surat has a decadal population growth of 60 per cent. The population explosion, mostly due to sustained large scale immigration, is explained by the fact
			 that Surat is a leading centre of two of the most labour intensive industries in the country: diamond and textiles. Migrant labour flooding the city from all across the country in search
			 of jobs is converting Surat into a mini India”, he says. Points out Dr. Rajender Kumar, District Collector of Surat and Chief Executive Authority Surat Urban Development
			 Authority, “SUDA is preparing a revised development plan for Surat and surrounding region with a 20-year perspective. Together with Surat Municipal Corporation, SUDA is
			 developing a 90-meter wide 66 km long outer ring road on the periphery of Surat city to decongest the traffic from the major Highways passing through the city. The
			 project, planned to be self-financed, has earned praise from the Central government which has asked other state governments to study the model for similar projects in their own states.”

		   <p align="left"><img src="<?php echo $baseUrl;?>images/special4.png" class="img-responsive" id="special4" align="right"/>
			 According to Mr. Zanzmera, “the fastgrowing population both of the people and vehicles galvanized the Surat Municipal Corporation into action and change
			 its work culture. To its credit, it responded befittingly and transformed Surat into one of the best cities in the country with a potable water coverage area of 95 percent,
			 a similar coverage area for drainage, solid waste management system to lift about 1200 tonnes of garbage every day through door-to-door collection. On health front,
			 Surat has a medical college attached to a 1000-bed hospital and 36 other hospitals, maternity homes and health centres.” Says Mr. Torawane, “Surat has widened its road network
			 with close circuit cameras in select areas and it can boast of polymer roads, dozens of flyovers and bridges and BRTS system.”
		  </p>
		  <p>
		     Maintaining that “exponential growth entails its own problems and troubles and Surat has had its fair share of these,” Mr. Zanzmera adds, “it has chosen to look to information
			 technology for solutions through e-governance and mobile governance. Interestingly, Surat was the first city in the country to start using information technology long before
			 even policy makers in Delhi recgonised its potential and importance. SMC is the first urban local self government body in the country to start computerization (in 1979),
			 develop and implement computerized payroll, property tax, vehicle tax and pension systems (1982-85), make the property tax system online (1990), have computerized accrual
			 based double entry accounting system (1992). It has a website of more than 1500 pages and was awarded certificate of Merit by NIUA and FIRE for the most comprehensive website in the country in the year 2001.”
		  </p>
		  <p align="left"><img src="<?php echo $baseUrl;?>images/special6.png" class="img-responsive" id="special6" align="right"/>
			 It is selected as the first smart IT city in India by the Microsoft CityNext Initiative in tie-up with IT services majors Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro. The city has 2.97
			 million of internet users which is about 65 per cent of total population. “Microsoft’s CityNext service will empower citizens in Surat with open data and digital way of accessing civic services,
			 thereby making Surat a Smart City. The engagement between Microsoft and SMC would involve citizen services Milind Torawane Municipal Commissioner across RTI, property tax payments, birth &
			 death registration, payment of municipal tenement installments, EWS housing, grievance redressal system, vaccination alert system, application tracking systems,
			 disease statistics/reports for hospitals and solid waste management system, professional tax registration and renewal. Also, it would include utility services including
			 water supply and sewage systems,” says Mr. Zanzmera.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			 “The SMC website has more than one lakh files of small medium and large sizes. The SMC receives about 15,000 applications every year under RTI, of which about
			 85-90 per cent are entertained. Disclosures under RTI are arranged and published in 17 manuals under the caption RTI”, he says. According to Mr. Milind Torawane, Municipal Commis-
			 sioner, “Microsoft CityNext is a people-first initiative to enable residents and city leaders to use technology to build a foundation for sustainable growth and prosperity.
			 It has been successfully implemented in cities across the world including Paris, Washington DC and Auckland. By transforming Surat into a smart city, we are setting
			 a benchmark for other cities in the country on how IT solutions can help empower citizens and address cities biggest challenges and fuel economic growth.” Also on cards are science centre, museum & auditorium, gardens, pay & use toilets, better bus stop design, allotment of space to handicapped persons for Livelihood
			 and integrated road development within the city. “Our primary objective is to provide basic civic amenities to the growing population of the city.These include Potable
			 water supply, Underground sewage system in the whole city,all weather roads, Efficient and sustainable solid waste management, Health coverage to all especially for
			 the poor,Primary education to the needy and library facility to all, upgradation of the amenities in the existing slums and alternative accommodation, Clean and green and pollution
			 free environment, Places of healthy entertainment and recreation, fire service and efficient urban planning and development,” says Mr. Zanzmera.

			 <h4>SUMUL</h4>
			 <h1>Blazing a white trail</h1>
			 <h4>Sumul is today reckoned as a leading cooperative organization not just in Gujarat but all across the country.</h4>
			 <p align="left"><img src="<?php echo $baseUrl;?>images/special7.png" class="img-responsive" id="special7" align="right"/>
			 Surat District Co-operative Milk Producers’ Union Limited (Sumul Dairy) is a co-operative endeavor committed to help marginal farmers and downtrodden
			 tribals to lead to a healthy life with better standard of living through scientific animal husbandry practices. Today, Sumul is feeling proud for serving milk and
			 milk products to populous Surat city and surrounding towns of the Surat district. Sumul Parivar salutes those crusaders who wisely thought of uniting milk producers
			 under one umbrella almost 64 years ago, in 1951, in order to get rid of exploitation by private milk traders of Surat, and planted a small sapling of a co-operative body. Today the sapling
			 has grown into a tree which is spreading its wings wide over 1095 village co-operative societies and 230,000 members.It was in 1951, when Surat District Co-operative Milk Producers Union Ltd. was registered
			 under the Bombay Co-operative Societies Act 1925 and with untiring and dedicated efforts by veteran Leaders of Co-opearative Movement a dairy plant was established at Surat
			 in 1968 with a milk handling capacity of 40,000 litres per day.
		  </p>
		  <p id="special2c" >
			 Sumul or Surat Milk Union Limited, which is now renamed as The Surat District Co-operative Milk Producers’ Union Ltd,is one of the 17 district
			 unions which act as manufacturing units of dairy products for Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation Limited, the marketers of Amul brand of products. Established in 1951 with six
			 milk producers’ cooperatives and 200 liters of milk, the union has grown into a premier cooperative organization which is spreading its wings wide over 1095 village co-operative societies and
			 230,000 members.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			 Mr. Mansinhbhai K. Patel, a prominent leader in Surat and Chairman of Sumul, sees a bright future for the dairy industry in the country. “Higher GDP growth, increased incomes in
			 rural areas thanks to schemes like MGNREGA, and a growing population are among major reasons for the rapidly growing demand for milk,” he adds.India is the largest milk producing nation in the world,
			 accounting for 18 per cent of the global production. According to the annual report of the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) for 2012-13, the country’s estimated milk
			 production stood at 132.4 million tonnes (mt). The report says that Gujarat was the fourth largest producer of milk in the country with production of 10.3 mt. During the year,
			 dairy cooperatives in the country collected 12 mt of milk, about 14 percent higher than 10.5 mt in the previous year. Liquid milk marketed by cooperatives increased by around 4
			 percent over the previous year to 8.9 MT.
		  </p>
		  <br/>
		  <img src="<?php echo $baseUrl;?>images/special8.png" class="img-responsive" id="special8" align="center"/><br/><br/>
		  <p>
		     According to estimates by Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), India’s milk production in 2013 was 141 million tonnes, 5.3 mt higher than that in 2012. Rising disposable incomes and population
		     growth are the two major dynamics behind the increase in India’s production and the country is largely absent from the international market for dairy products. FAO
		     estimated global milk production in 2013 to grow by 1.9 percent to 780 million tonnes in line with the recent trend. Surat District has been a pioneer in India in channeling
		     trade in Cotton and Milk through co-operatives. In 1940s, milk distribution in Surat, as elsewhere in the state, was dominated by private vendors who frequently abused their
		     monopoly position to squeeze both the milk producer and the consumer. Milk producers had to settle for low unremunerative prices in the absence of marketing infrastructure
		     and storage or processing facilities. Consumers, on the other hand, had to put up with high prices, indifferent quality and, often, unbridled adulteration.
		 </p>
		 <p align="left"><img src="<?php echo $baseUrl;?>images/special9.png" class="img-responsive" id="special9" align="right"/>
			 Hence, the Surat District Co. operative Milk Producers’ Union Ltd., better known by its trade name Sumul which literally means good value, was set in August 1951. Its objective
			 was to salvage milk producers from the clutches of the private traders and also offer a fair deal to the consumers through organisation and integration of procurement, processing
			 and marketing of milk and milk products by the producers themselves on sound cooperative line. This was expected to ensure elimination of middlemen, equitable distribution
			 of benefits to rural milk producers and indirectly to urban milk consumers as well.Sumul forms the second tier of the three-tier cooperative
			 system in Gujrat. Milk producers are members of a villagelevel cooperative, which are engaged in milk collection and distribution of cattle feed. The village societies keep accounts,
			 pay according to milk quality and help standardise practices. Village societies form a district-level union. They have representation on the boards of directors of the
			 district union of cooperatives such as Sumul. Various district level unions have federated themselves into a state level apex federation (Amul), and the chairmen
			 of the district unions are directors on the board of the federation. The federation seeks to market products of member unions, ensure an assured outlet for milk
			 and a fair return to producers, and an adequate return to the member unions through development of their processing and product manufacturing facilities.

		  <p>
			 “Sumul is thus working as a vital link between milk producers and consumers and working for the economic development and upliftmentn of the farmers in the rural areas,” says Mr. Pravinbhai Gamit,
	         Vice-Chairman.
		  </p>
		  <p align="left"><img src="<?php echo $baseUrl;?>images/special11.png" class="img-responsive" id="special11" align="right"/>
			 From a modest beginning in 1951 with 6 milk producers’ cooperatives and 200 liters of milk, Sumul has now flourished into a large union of 1095 cooperative societies (of
			 which 125 are all-women societies) representing 2.30 lakh milk producers. The average daily milk procurement amounted to 10,44,581 liter and sale to 855,695 liters in 2013-14. Sumul sold 133709 tonnes of
			 cattle feed.
			 <h4>OBJECTIVES OF SUMUL</h4>
			 (1) To provide guaranteed remunerative year round milk market to milk producers for their surplus milk and to ensure them reasonable returns for the milk,
			 to improve their quality of life. (2) To procure milk and process it into good quality milk and milk products in order to market it most economically and efficiently to give maximum overall net
			 returns to the producers and general satisfaction to the consumers. (3) To provide essential inputs and services to the producers at their doorsteps in an economic and efficient manner
			 and also in a way, most acceptable to them to increase milk production and to reduce the cost of production.Sumul or Surat Milk Union Limited, which is now renamed
			 as The Surat District Co-operative Milk Producers’ Union Ltd,is one of the 17 district unions which act as manufacturing units of dairy products for Gujarat Co-operative
			 Milk Marketing Federation Limited, the marketers of Amul brand of products. Based in Anand town of Gujarat and created by the visionary Dr. Verghese Kurian, Amul is a unique
			 dairy co-operative movement in India, praised all over the world as an extraordinary and reliable model for rural development.
		  </p>
		  <p align="left"><img src="<?php echo $baseUrl;?>images/special12.png" class="img-responsive" id="special12" align="right"/>
			 With a turnover of Rs. 2007 crore, Sumul has brought about a sea-change in rural areas of Surat district. Says Mr. Mansinhbhai K Patel, far-sighted Chairman of the Surat District
			 Co-operative Milk Producers’ Union Ltd, “The sale of milk has provided income to several families below the poverty line, landless labourers, small farmers and several uneducated
			 and unemployed youth. Milk production has helped thousands of farmers who are hit by recession in the agriculture sector.” Mr. Patel, a veteran leader in the space of co-operative
			 movement, gives credit to the cooperative movement in Gujarat inspired by visionary leaders like Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. “Surat district has always been in the forefront of the
			 cooperative movement in Gujarat where it is marching ahead with an unstoppable momentum. Sumul occupies a pride of place in that glorious movement. Sumul is today reckoned
			 as a leading cooperative organization not just in Gujarat but all across the country,” adds Mr. Patel. The main plant at Surat has a processing capacity of 10
			 lakh liters per day (LLPD).  But many times it reaches upto 13 lakh litres. Now, the management has planned to raise the installed capacity to 15 lakh litres, which will be operational in 2015-16. Besides, it has chilling
			 centres at Bajipura (3 LLPD), Navi Pardi (2 LLPD) and Uchchhal (1 LLPD) and Nizar (0.5 LLPD). The cattle feed factory at Chalthan has a capacity for producing
			 300 tonnes per day of quality balanced cattle feed and distributing it to the milk producer members at no-profit-no-loss basis.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			 Its product range has expanded far beyond plain milk to flavoured milk, varieties of curd and butter milk, ghee, paneer, khoya, peda, shrikhand, ghari,
			 gulab jamun, rasgullas, and, yes, tea. For enhanced assurance of milk producers, Sumul has set up 1523 automatic milk collection centres where the producer, on
			 depositing milk, immediately gets an automatic slip showing milk fat, SNS, quantity and price.
		  </p>
		  <p align="left"><img src="<?php echo $baseUrl;?>images/special13.png" class="img-responsive" id="special13" align="right"/>
			 Pointing out that “the milk producer is at the centre of all our activities,” Mr. Jayesh Desai, dynamic Managing Director of Sumul adds “in the year ended March 2014, Sumul
			 had a turnover of Rs. 2007.81 crore. It procured 39.03 crore liters of milk from members for which it paid Rs. 1198 crore. In other words, over 75 per cent of our income is distributed
			 year, we paid milk producers a higher price of Rs. 568 per kg of fat, compared with Rs. 511 in the previous year,” adds Mr.Desai.It has been an uphill task over the decades, necessitating
			 sincere and dedicated work from the staffers and field workers.Ten out of 14 tehsils of Surat and Tapi districts are tribal and backward areas, with some of the villages situated
			 as much as 200 km away from Surat city. Dairying was never popular with tribals due to absence of infrastructure for milk marketing in their talukas, inaccessibility of their
			 villages and taboos regarding keeping of buffaloes. The tribals maintained their cows to produce bullocks rather than milk, which was insufficient even to nurse the calves.
			 Most of the tribals were unaware of the usual milch breeds, to say nothing of scientific animal husbandry. Few tribal villages had surplus milk for sale to cooperatives.
		  </p>
		  <p>
			 Sumul, therefore, began with publication of an extension pamphlet explaining benefits of cattle breeding and related matters and extending loans for purchase of
			 milch cattle. Setting up cooperative societies was only the beginning. Sumul followed it up with other measures to bring the proverbial last man into the mainstream
			 of the cooperative movement. For this purpose, it carried out education and awareness programmes, provided technical and trained personnel, created infrastructure
			 like Dudh Mandali Ghar, chilling centers, cattle feed factory, veterinary services, automatic milk collection system, bulk milk coolers, solar systems and automization.
			 This created transparency and built trust in the milk business.
		  </p>
		 <p align="left"><img src="<?php echo $baseUrl;?>images/special14.png" class="img-responsive" id="special14" align="right"/>
			 According to Dr. Pushpakant Pandey, CEO, “the task of strengthening and empowering the milk producers continues apace.Since cattle feed is a major expense
			 item for the milk producer, Sumul provides improved fodder seeds with high nutritive value at subsidized prices, the sale of which was 791 tonnes last year. To bring down the cost of production and increase
			 per animal milk production at village level, services of vet Doctors (67) and technical officers (57) have been hired.” Adds the Chairman Mr. Patel with justifiable pride on his
			 face, “while the national average of milk production per animal per day is around 5.5 litres, it is 11.5 litres per animal per day in the case of Sumul in Mahuva Taluka
			 and 8.5 liters in other areas. Sumul is deeply engaged in improving the number of highly genetically potential cattle and buffalo. It trains milk producers in artificial insemination, first aid and scientific
			 animal husbandry. Under the Fertility Improvement Program (FIP) and NECO programme, Non pregnant cattle and buffalo heifers and Non pregnant dry cows and buffaloes
			 are given fertility kit (Elite cattle feed Concentrate of 3 bags and Special fertility treatment) to bring about calving at early age and to reduce inter calving period.
		  </p>

			 According to Mr. Patel, with a view to develop cow bulls 54 Corporate India  January 15, 2015 and buffalo bulls with high genetic potentiality for
			 natural service, a Breeding Center has been established at Vanskui of Mahuva taluka. An “Elite herd” is being formed in Mahuva, Vyara, Songadh, Olpad & Mandvi talukas under DIPA
			 scheme wherein high profile animals are reared and inseminated with nominated mating or inseminated by proven bull semen dose and Elite male calves procured are tested for
			 genetic  diseases and selected for semen production. NDDB selected more than 160 Elite Bulls for semen production at SAG Bidaj. A methane biogas plant has been activated At
			 Vanskui centre. Power produced from this plant is used for lighting of cattle sheds and running hydroponics plant (Hydroponics produces green fodder without
			 land and with negligible water requirement). Sumul dairy also distributes cows and buffaloes to female milk producer members with interest free loans under Mahila Sanman Yojana. Sumul also provides
			 unit loans to unemployed educated persons under which they are provided units of 5, 10, 15 or 20 animals. Sumul has also established community based biogas plant at Bhitbudrak village with capacity of 80 cubic
			 meters which is working efficiently and providing  gas for cooking at reasonable rates.

		  <img src="<?php echo $baseUrl;?>images/special16.png" class="img-responsive" id="special16" align="right"/>
		  
		  <p>
			 Energy efficient pumps are being activated at chilling centres at Bajipura, Uchchhal, Navi Pardi and Nizar. Energy saving systems like LED lights, lighting stabilizer,
		     automatic compressed air system, side entry agitator, PHE, PRS and condensed recovery systems are being activated. In appreciation of these efforts to save energy,
			 Sumul has been given an award by the President of India.
		  </p>
		 <p align="left"><img src="<?php echo $baseUrl;?>images/special17.png" class="img-responsive" id="special17" align="right"/>
			 “Achievement in quality and safety of milk has drawn maximum returns to milk producers. This has stopped the migration,naxalism and anti-social activity
			 in rural area. Employment has increased, especially for women”, insists Mr. Patel. To speed up milk processing, facilitate introduction of new products in the market and
			 increase the capacity of the plant, machineries with well advanced technology are being purchased and the plant is being expanded step by step. According to Mr. Patel, Sumul is on the growth path to
			 scale new heights. It has planned capital expenditure of Rs. 93 crore for the current fiscal. At the main plant in Surat, pasteurizer, homogenizer & cream separator plants with a
			 capacity of 30,000 liters per hour being activated to strengthen milk quality. Also, to speed up packing procedure, 5 packing machines are being installed. An automatic
			 continuous butter making machine, with 2 tonnes per hour capacity is being installed. A double head rotor curd packing machine is being added. A slab construction work joining
			 two buildings is being completed & first floor slab work is being started. Work on a new boiler room and a new overhead tank is nearing completion.
