			<h4>New year worries for Mukesh Ambani</h4>
			<h1>Happy new year ahead</h1>
		   <p>
			 Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries will be embarking on a big gamble in the new year. The company plans to invest $12 billion in the telecom business which is making
			 analysts jittery. What is worrying the investors even more is its $7-billion investment in the US shale gas sector.

			 The New York state has banned fracking in the state on health reasons saying that the fracking along with horizontal drilling and chemical laced water can increase risk of can-
			 cer, skin rashes and upper respiratory problems. If other states in the US follow suit, it could place billions of dollars of investment in trouble, say analysts. The falling crude oil price
			 is another worry as it makes shale gas unviable. Though RIL says it will not be impacted much, the company has already put its 45 per cent stake in its joint venture
			 at Eagle Ford with Pioneer Natural Resources on the block at a valuation of $4.5 billion. The sale is targeted for conclusion early next year. This comes when investors are still waiting for returns on
			 investments in the retail sector.   Let us hope RIL and Ambani have a good year in 2015.

			<h1>Birla and Jaypee in a shady deal?</h1>
		   <p>
			 Numerous irregularities have allegedly been committed in Aditya Birla group’s takeover of Jaypee group’s cement unit in Gujarat last year. The
			 state government has been deprived of crores of rupees in the stamp duty through undervaluation of the assets, it is said. A representation to
			 the chief minister says that the land on which the factory stands has not been declared NA (non-agricultural) so far and Japyee has not even paid the required premium of about Rs. 800 crore for the purpose.
		  </p>
		   
		  <p align="left"><img src="<?php echo $baseUrl; ?>images/jaypee.png" class="img-responsive" align="right"/> 
			 The biggest irregularities alleged pertained to the mining activities of the company. The mines that were leased by the state government to the Jaypee
			 group for a period of 30 years have been transferred to Ultratech in clear breach of the terms of lease agree ment which forbids transfer of mines to third parties. The Japyee group
			 mined lime stones in much larger quantities than it was permitted to, alleges the representation and goes on to say that the same kind of mining activity is carried out now be Ultratech without any legal sanction.
			 Meanwhile, Kumar Mangalam Birla’s Ultratech has now bought the MP plants of Jaypee Cements at an enterprise valuation of Rs. 5,000 crore. This is the second time Birla has bought the cement plants from Jaypee after buying its Gujarat plants last year. But Birla, who prefers to
			 keep a low profile, is nowadays busy consolidating operations of the group and plans to sell stake in its retail vertical to a clutch of private equities. 
		  </p>
			<p align="left"><img src="<?php echo $baseUrl; ?>images/kumar.png" class="img-responsive" id="img-birla" align="left"/> 
			 This comes within months of his selling off the group’s BPO business - Minacs for $260 million. Birla is now offering stake in the retail business so that fresh capital can be invested in the loss-making business.
			 But he is not finding any takers. Both Birla and Ambani thought they will become Wal-Marts of India, but the online business has changed the dynamics of the game. Now the younger generation prefers to sit at home
			 and order everything online rather than buying it from offline shops.<br/> Coming back to Jaypee’s problems, bankers say by selling assets orth Rs. 20,000 crore, the company has managed to bring down its
			 debt levels to manageable levels but this is certainly not the last chapter in the beleagured group’s history.

			<h1>Rough ride for Rajiv Bajaj</h1>
		   <p>
			 Bajaj Auto seems to be in deep trouble with competitors like Honda slowly eating into its market shares. The company led by Rajiv Bajaj plans
			 to launch new products in domestic 2-wheeler segment in order to regain the lost market share. The company plans to launch new self-start Platina and may introduce a new brand between Platina and
			 Discover. In the executive segment, it plans two more Discover variants in 100/125cc once the recently launched Discover 150 establishes itselfin the premium commuter segment. In the premium segment, the company
			 plans four new Pulsar variants: 150cc and 200cc engine options with semi-fairing, Pulsar SS 200 and Pulsar 400 to cater to high end cruiser bikes
		  </p>
		   
		  <p align="left"><img src="<?php echo $baseUrl; ?>images/rajiv.png" class="img-responsive" align="right"/> 
			 But investors are not convinced. They expect Bajaj Auto to face significant headwinds across segments in the near term due to Bajaj’s decision
			to stay away from the fast growing scooter segment where the scooter segment grew by 24 per cent as compared to motorcycles which will grow by 8 per cent over the next four years. Analysts say launch of multiple
			variants of existing motorcycle brands, especially Discover (probably accentuating confusion in the minds of customers), is unlikely to help in arresting its market share loss. In the exports market (46 per cent
			of projected revenue in 2014-15) Bajaj already has high market share in bigger markets like Nigeria, Egypt & Sri Lanka and could see higher competition from entry of TVS, Hero and Honda besides the near term macroeconomic
			risks within oil exporting countries. Analysts believe this couldimpact  Bajaj’s exports margins negatively.

			<h1>Rough ride for Rajiv Bajaj</h1>
		   <p>
			 Sajjan Jindal, Chairman of JSW group had a good year. Jindal took over Jaypee’s hydro power projects for Rs. 9600 crore and Welspun’s loss-making plant for Rs. 1000
			 crore. But after the announcement comes the big question. 
		   </p>
		  <p align="left"><img src="<?php echo $baseUrl; ?>images/sajjan.png" class="img-responsive" align="right"/> 
		     How will the company raise funds? Jindal has to raise funds for the acquisition of Jaypee assets and for its expansion at Bellari.  
			 And yes, Jindal will also be facing a Central Bureau of Investigation inquiry into alleged irregularities in environment clearance to acquire land in Ankua,
			 Jharkhand. So, as far as 2015 is concerned do not expect too many big bang announcements from Jindal.  Next year, Jindal wants to take Bellari production capacity to 20 million tonnes and
			 plans to set up a 500-km slurry pipeline to transport iron ore from Goa to his plant in Karnataka.  Interestingly, Jindal also got into sports business in a big way by buying stake
			 in FC Bangalore with the football business now looked after by his 24-year old son Parth.
