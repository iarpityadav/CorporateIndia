				 <h4>WHERE TO INVEST IN 2015?</h4>
				 <p align=""> 2014 was a watershed. It was dominated by politics. In 2015 the focus will be on the economy, national and global. 2015 will be a year of challenges. The
						economy is not out of woods. Fiscal deficit is worryingly high. But political stability, an alert RBI and decline in global commodity prices would serve India well. The strong dollar and impending rate hike by US Fed in face of downtrend in other major
						economies could hit emerging markets on exports and capital flows. The next six months is not a time to take undue risks in your portfolio. We suggest a few scrips which are likely to outperform the market and provide decent returns.

					 2014 will go down the history as a watershed. In the most bitterly contested Lok Sabha elections since 1977,Narendra Modi drove the BJP-led NDA to a resounding victoryon the promise of political stability and economic dynamism with a focus on reforms, faster growth and jobs. Financial
					 markets had started betting on his victory even before elections were formally announced. They went ecstatic after the results, pushing the Sensex to new all-time peaks and backing the rupee to stand up to the mighty dollar.
				 </p>
				 <p align="left">The BSE Sensex touched the peak of 28,822 on 28
					November before the closing the year at 27,403.54 with a gain of 6201.16 points or 29 per cent. The small and midcap stocks yielded even higher returns, with BSE mid-cap
					index closing 49 per cent higher and the small cap index gaining almost 67 per cent. Interestingly, the FII preference shifted from equity to debt. FII investment in equities plummeted
					to $16.494 billion in 2014, compared with $40.2 billion in 2013, where that in debt soared to $26.18 billion from a negative $15.94 billion in 2013.
				 </p>
				 <p align="left">
					 In contrast, gold and silver disappointed once again giving negative returns for the third year in a row. Gold closed the year at $1195 an ounce, down from $1240 a year ago and silver finished at $16.08 an ounce, compared with $19.1 a year ago.
				 </p>
				 <p align="left">
					 As the year comes to a close, the euphoria has started receding. Some of Mr. Modi’s most vocal supporters ranging from leading industrialists and NRIs visiting home to middle class housewives in cities have started complaining that he
					 is to yet to deliver on his tall promises. To be sure, the overall mood is still highly optimistic and Mr. Modi’s popularity has gone up since he assumed office.
				 </p>
				 <p align="left">
					 2015 promises to be a year of challenges. The first challenge is to accelerate the growth momentum which alone can
					 generate millions of growth that Modi promised. The economy is still struggling to come out of the morass into which it had fallen in the UPA reign. The international situation is likely to throw up some serious challenges in the areas of exports andm capital flows. The economic growth is expected to inch up to 5.5 per cent this year, compared with below 5 per cent last year. However, the expectations of a return to heady days of 8-9 per cent growth are fast receding.
				 </p>
				 <p align="left">The recent GDP numbers show that the economy is still not out of woods. For the quarter ended September, India’s  gross domestic product (GDP) grew 5.3 per cent, compared with 5.7 per cent in the previous quarter. Industrial production
					remains stagnated. The index of industrial productiondeclined by 4.2 per cent in October,as against minus 1.2 percent in October 2013. The ‘low base’ points to a dire situation,belying claims that the worst is over.
				 </p>
				 <p align="left">The government has tried its utmost to clear supply bottlenecks, delivering a sentiment-booster for India Inc. The prime minister has personally assumed chairmanship of the project
					monitoring group to expedite clearances. But a supply-side push will require support from the demand side, which is not in evidence. Consumer demand, investment and exports all remain weak. Growth data points to a near-stagnation in investment
					in a solute terms. Corporates are faced with low utilisaiton of capacities and mountains of debt; banks are reeling under NPAs and capital adequacy issues.	
				</p>
				 <p align="left">
					 Another challenge is the widening fiscal deficit, which reached nearly 90 per cent of the Budget Estimate for the fiscal in the first seven months itself. The Government has set a limit of Rs. 5.31 lakh crore for the full year but the
					deficit reached Rs. 4.76 lakh crore in the April-October period. The key concern on the fiscal deficit front is the dipping evenues.
					Tax receipts grew by just 3.46 per cent against the 19.8 per cent target. Total indirect tax collections for AprilOctober 2014 are up by a nominal 3.46 per cent (net of states’ share). If one adjusts for inflation, the tax collection growth would be close to zero.
				 </p>
				 <p align="left">
					 The government may have to slash budgeted expenditureby about Rs. 1 lakh crore if were to stick to the fiscal deficittarget of 4.1 per cent of the GDP for the current year.
					 The axe is likely to fall on capital expenditure, besides social schemes, which in turn could hurt growth.
				 </p>
				 <p align="left">
					 On the positive side, inflation has dropped consider- ably. The consumer price index numbers for November at 4.38 per cent, with food inflation at just 3.14 per cent. The WPI inflation in November dropped to zero. Indeed, if global
					 commodities, especially oil, continue to fall, WPI could even go into the negative territory: primary commodities contracted 0.98 per cent and fuel/power fell 4.91 per cent in November.
				 </p>
				 <p align="left">While the drop in inflation may act as a consolation, there is no surprise here. The fall has been exaggerated by the ‘high base’ effect, or double-digit rates of inflation last year. Besides, it may also be reflection of the absence of
				    growth and job creation.
				 </p>
				 <p align="left">
					 The international situation is developing in a manner that could pose major challenge to India in the coming year.
				 </p>
				 <p align="left">
					 The US recovery is gaining ground. The US economy grew at 4.2 per cent in the last two quarters and the jobless rate is down to 5.8 per cent. The US Fed is likely to raise interest rates by the middle of the next year. Probably, it
					 would have raised them earlier but for the weakness in other major economies. China is slowing down, Japan is in recession and Europe in struggling to shake off its stagnation through loose monetary policy. Oil prices have tumbled in the world market, from $115 per barrel in June to $57 now
					 owing to weak demand and oversupply. Russia is in a major trouble with zero growth, high inflation and the ruble plunging  against dollar.
				 </p>
				 <p align="left">
					 As a result, dollar has strengthened against all major currencies. The rupee, which had held ground for a few months, is now down to Rs. 63.11 and is expected to stabilize between 64 and 65 to a dollar.
					 The outlook for the Indian currency in the coming months remains weak
				 </p>
				 <p align="left">
					 As an oil importer, India is delighted with the fall in oil prices. However, if the fall forces some oil exporters to default on their external commitments, it might trigger a broader
					 crisis engulfing all emerging markets including India. Risk aversion among investors may lead to withdrawal of capital form emerging markets, hitting their currencies and financial markets.
				 </p>
				 <p align="left">
					 <h4>  2015: Global growth to accelerate</h4><img src="<?php echo $baseUrl; ?>images/coverstory4.jpg" class="img-responsive" align="center"/><h4>(Goldman sachs)</h4>
				 </p>
				 <p align="left">
					 West Asian oil exporters are major destinations for Indian exports and labour, so crashing oil prices can mean a steep fall in India’s exports to and remittances from the Gulf.
					 The same could be said for Europe and China. This will be offset by cheaper oil imports, but the equilibrium may be reached at a slower GDP growth rate.
				 </p>
				 <p align="left">
					 Finally, global finance may be poised to exit from emerging markets anyway with the end of quantitative easing and expected rise in US interest rates in mid-2015.
				 </p>
				 <p align="left">
					 2015, therefore, promises to be a challenging year. However, there is no reason for panic. We have a politically stable government headed by a prime minister who is not only charismatic but also an able administrator and a visionary leader. An alert Reserve Bank of India and the decline
					 in commodity prices are other positives for the economy.
				 </p>
				 <p align="left">
						Reforms have been initiated in most of the areas that require improvement. The recent ordinances on coal mine auctions and FDI in insurance have gone down well with the investors. An ordinance making major changes in the land
						acquisition law is next in line. The prime minister has assumed chairmanship of the Project Monitoring Group to expedite and revive stalled projects. Efforts are being made towards easing the conduct of business through greater use of technology,
						facilitating labour law improvements and developing worldclass infrastructure. E-biz platform and the Digital India campaign are going to play a vital role in integrating all government
						department and services. The development of industrial corridors, 100 smart cities, opening up of Railways infrastructure to FDI, plans for bullet trains, the Sagarmala project for development of ports, development of low-cost airports, etc, will play a critical
						role in enhancing business competitiveness, triggering economic activity and generating huge employment. The government’s initiatives on these fronts are likely to show results in the year 2015.
						The next trigger for stock markets would be the budget. If Mr. Jaitley meets the expectations of the business and industry, the economy will take off and the bullish sentiment will be reinforced. However, if his next budget is on the same line
						as the last one, it will be hard to avoid disappointment and even disillusionment.

							 <span id="sen4">Anand Rathi</span>: Currently, the valuation of Indian stocks are close to the long-term mean. Therefore, this cannot be called expensive. It is true that the market has run-up in

				 <h4 align="center">Outlook for 2015</h4>
				 <p > 
					 India is among the top-performing emerging markets in 2014. When the Sensex has gained around 30%. Smaller companies have fared even better, with the BSE Mid Cap index surging 56%
					 and the BSE Small Cap Index jumping 75%. What is the outlook for 2015? Some fund managers believe that economic prospects have improved, but the New Year may be tougher for equity
					 investors to make money as valuations of many stocks are rich after the broad-based rally in 2014. Concern over interest rate hike in the US and weak global crude oil prices may also
					 keep investors on edge. Though the falling crude prices have improved the prospects of the Indian economy, India may not be spared if there is an emerging market sell-off. “On the global front, oil exporting nations could face problems,
					 and there could be a global risk aversion. This could lead to volatile markets in the near term,” maintains Sankaran Naren, chief investment officer, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund.
					 Market participants consider probable interest rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) as the biggest trigger for the economy and the markets. The extent of monetary policy easing would determine the strength of rally in shares
					 of the so-called interest rate-sensitive sectors such as banks, auto, real estate and bonds. According to a fund manager, debt funds could offer good returns in the coming year as a fall in interest rates could lead to an appreciation in bond
					 prices. With wholesale price inflation coming at nil for November, expectations of interest rate cuts as early as in the March quarter are high. “Shortterm rates can fall more than long-term rates. We expect consumer inflation to be
					 in the range of 5-5.5%, and expect RBI to cut interest rates by 50 basis points in 2015,” said Dhawal Dalal, executive V-P and  .. and head (fixed income), DSP BlackRock Mutual Fund. If interest rates fall by 50 basis points, investors
				     could see a 5% capital appreciation on their long-term gilt fund portfolio
				 </p>
				 <p>
					 Add to that the coupon of 8.4%, investors could get a return of as much as 13-14%, over a one year timeframe. Among banks, fund managers advise buying public sector banks, which could benefit from a rally in bond prices
					 because of their bond portfolio. “Interest rates could go down by about 150 basis points over a 2-year timeframe,” says Manish Dangi, co-chief investment officer, Birla SunlifeMutual Fund.
					 Sceptics, however, warn that further weakness in the rupee could delay rate cuts in 2015. Also, a drop in the rupee could dissuade foreign institutional investors (FIIs) from making fresh purchases in Indian stocks.
					 Some fund managers expect the ‘Make in India’ theme to benefit companies in the manufacturing sector. “Ordering cycle will pick up in the coming year which will benefit a whole host of companies,” said PVK Mohan, head (equities), Principal Mutual Fund.

						 “SENSEX may reach up to the level of 35000 in 2015 backed up by economic turnaround, GDP growth in the range of 6.5% to 7% and attractive equity valuations

						 India more attractive for investments. Expected FDI inflows into India with a friendly policy regime at the center, rupee is expected to firm up to allow India to benefit from the
						 reduced international oil prices.” Maintains Dr. V.V.L.N. Sastry, Director FirstCall India in an interview to <b>Corporate India</b>.

						<br/>
						<span id="sen3">Corporate India :</span> <i>The market sentiment after the change of the government at the Centre had turned highly positive and the benchmark stock indices were ruling

						<br/>
						<span id="sen4">Dr. V.V.L.N. Sastry :</span> The current selling pressure is due to the unexpected fall in oil prices due to the spurt in production of oil and gas in USA. The additional capacities along with the required logistics
						put in place by the US have started yielding results by reducing the dependence of the US on other countries for oil. This made the oil and gas producers across the world to face the scenario of surplus capacities leading to crash in oil
						prices. The economies which depend on oil and gas for their survival such as Venezuela, Russia, Nigeria and Middle East including Saudi Arabia. This crash in oil prices led to US $ appreciation which made some international fund managers to resort to a knee jerk reaction
						of booking profits in the emerging markets including India. Actually fundamentals of Indian markets are stronger now to what they were prior to oil prices crash. As a blessing in disguise, the sudden fall in the oil prices internationally and corresponding reduction in domestic oil prices helped contain the inflation in
						India. The current account deficit and fiscal deficit are also going to get reduced over a period of time thus making the macro economy of India much stronger. Though rupee depreciated in the recent past, it was due to the FII selling as a flash reach to US $
						appreciation. Given the strong fundamentals which keep India distinct from other countries, in 2015 our markets are once again poised for a good appreciation.

				 <h6 id="ex1">What investors should do</h6>
				 <p > 
					 The next six months is not a time to take undue risks in your portfolio. Invest or stay invested only in stocks that you know and understand. Resist the temptation
				     to leverage i.e. play the derivatives market un- less you know the level of capital that you are willing to risk in a volatile market. Finally, it is safe to have a diversified portfolio that would spread the risk across
					 several sectors. The Indian market has a number of sectors that can do well. There are dollar-sensitive sectors (pharmaceuticals, software, textiles) to hedge near-term taper fears. Then there
					 are sectors such as autos, private banks, oil which flourish on hopes of better reform environment and an economic improvement. Finally, there are deep cyclical which include beaten down infra stocks and public sector banks.
					 Corporate India’s research team has selected a few scrips for investment in 2015, which are likely to outperform the market and provide decent returns to the investors. Heregoes the list:

					 <div class="content">
					 <h4>–  Arvind Sethi</h4>
					 <p align="left"><img src="<?php echo $baseUrl; ?>images/coverstory6.jpg" class="img-responsive" align="left"/> 
						 The calendar year 2015 will be a year of transition albeit a slower one but a positive one for both the economy and the debt market. The year would see RBI initiating the long awaited rate cut process, while on the other hand, markets will be keen to see the
						 reforms process gathering pace. The shift of household savings from physical assets to financial instruments due to falling inflation and higher real rates will lead to capital flows to real sector. Implementation
						 of the much awaited Goods & Service Tax will lead to improvement in tax revenues and a big positive for the economy. We expect G-sec yields to be volatile with a downward bias on the back of rate
						 cut expectations and gradual fall in CPI. RBI may initiate rate cuts in the first quarter of 2015. I also expect the 10yr benchmark yield to trade around 7.50% levels by the second half of the calendar year 2015.
						 On the corporate debt side I have a negative bias towards lower rated bonds which are currently trading at compressed spreads. While we expect the government issuances to moderate on the back of fiscal prudence policy of government we see the corporate
						 issuances to increase due to improvement in credit off-take and capital investment. We are however, positive on AAA rated papers than lower rated ones. Duration strategies would yield better return opportunities than accrual going forward. The risk to this view is the volatility in crude prices, currency volatility and external geopolitical risks.
					 </p>
					 <h4 align="left">Outlook for Equity in 2015</h4>
					 <p align="left">I continue to retain positive outlook on the Indian equity markets over the medium term. After a strong run up in 2014,markets are trading at fair valuations. With global liquidity remaining benign and India being viewed favourably by globalinvestors due to a reformist government, and a beneficiary of lower commodity prices; the valuations are likely to remain well
						supported. Markets would now reward earning growth and a further re-rating on valuations would be contingent on earnings improvement. As the pace of the economy improves over the next few quarters and inflation shows signs of cooling, corporate balancesheet and cash flows are likely to see improvement and thus, broader market will continue to look attractive in 2015.
						I believe a bottom up approach to investing will set us up for decent returns. Among sectors, I continue to like and remain invested in auto/auto ancillaries, cement, consumer discretionary, capital goods and pharmaceuticals. I am equal weights on BFSI and IT. I continue to remain underweight on metals, oil and gas, consumer staples and Realty sector.
						I feel the main risks to markets are global. Competitive devaluation and resultant moves in currency markets and recessionary conditions in many economies of the world can lead to higher volatility in the markets. I would urge investors
						to invest systematically in the equity market and use the possible increase in volatility to their advantage.

						 The largest private sector bank of the country ICICI Bank is on the growth path and with the change in government at the Centre, improvement in macro-economic environment,
						 resolution of infrastructure bottlenecks which would help release funds locked in infra loans and, above all, with the possibility of an interest rate cut in the very near future, the
						 prospects for the bank will improve very significantly.

					 <p align="left"><img src="<?php echo $baseUrl; ?>images/coverstory8.jpg" class="img-responsive" align="right"/> 
						 The bank is making steady progress despite the overall economic slowdown. During the last five years, its revenues have expanded from Rs. 33,185 crore in the fiscal 2010 to Rs. 54,606 crore in the fiscal 2014 and its
						 profit at net level has more than doubled from Rs. 4025 crore to Rs. 9810 crore during this period. The half-time performance in the current year is all the more encouraging with revenues amounting to around Rs. 29,500 crore and
						 the net profit crossing Rs. 5300 crore. A plus point for the bank is a sharp rise in CASA and retail deposits during the last few years – from 29 per cent in March 2009 to 44 per cent in September 2014. During the same period, the bank’s retail 
						 deposits have advanced by 50 per cent – from 50 per cent to 75 per cent. The impact is fully visible: the bank’s net interest margin has inched up from 2.64 per cent in 2010-11 to 3.41 per cent in the first half of 2015.

						 EROS International, a well-known name in the Indian entertainment industry, is a leading producer, acquirer and distributor of Indian language films and has one of the largest
						 film libraries of over 1200 films (by September 2014). In an industry cursed with uncertainties and fluctuating fortunes, Eros is a steady player, having shown dexterity in movie selection. It released
						 77 movies in 2012-13 and in fiscal 2013-14 the number of its releases was 69. Last year, it was present in 5 out of 10 box office hits. It raised its stature and earned huge profits by releasing
						 “Goliyon Ki Rasleela – Ram Leela’, Jai Ho, R. Rajkumar,Grand Masti, Raanjhanan, Yeh Jawani Hai Deewani (overseas) and one Nenokkadine (Telugu). EROS also enjoys a competitive advantage in terms of strong international presence owing to its parent company
						 Eros PLC.
					 </p>
					 <p align="left"><img src="<?php echo $baseUrl; ?>images/coverstory9.jpg" class="img-responsive" align="right"/> 
						 The company is doing quite well on the theatrical segment, but it is not totally dependent on it. Monetisation of its huge movie library over pay TV, innovative box office performance-linked
						 satellite rights and preview over premium TV (like HBO Defined and HBO Hits) has started contributing around 35 to 40 per cent of the total revenues. Of late, the company has entered the developing field of
						 mobile value added service by acquiring a controlling stake in Tech Zone. This acquisition, costing around Rs. 50 crore, will enable the company to tap mobile subscribers in India. Again, the company has tied up with Hathway Cable for marketing its
						 premium ‘Eros Now’ services to their subscribers.As entertainment industry is a growth area, the company is also growing steadily on the financial front. During
						 the last five years, its revenues have expanded from Rs. 478 crore in the fiscal 2011 to Rs. 857 crore in the fiscal 2014 with the net profit moving up from Rs. 70 crore to Rs. 114
						 crore during this period. The company is sitting on reserves of over Rs. 900 crore – nearly ten times its equity capital of Rs. 91.97 crore. Prospects are all the better in view of the widely shared
						 expectations that with the change of government the economy will revive and the entertainment industry will get a boost from a growing middle class and favourable demographics(population with a medium age of just 27 years).

						 State Bank of India, India's largest banking entity withn more than 16,000 branches, $300 billion in deposits and over $260 billion in advances, is not a nationalised bank

					 <p align="left"><img src="<?php echo $baseUrl; ?>images/coverstory13.jpg" class="img-responsive" align="right"/> 
						 The size has bestowed upon the bank a lot of advantages. Moreover, besides pure banking SBI has entered several related financial segments like
						 mutual fund, insurance etc. This has enabled the bank to cross-sell its fee-based products to a large depositor base. The bank's business has been growing from strength
						 to strength. During the last five years, its revenues have expanded from Rs. 86,962 crore in the fiscal year 2010 to Rs. 154,904 crore in the fiscal 2014. The net profit moved
						 up from Rs. 9166 crore in FY 2010 to Rs. 14,105 crore in the fiscal 2013 but slid back to Rs. 10,891 crore last year on account of widespread economic slowdown and rising
						 NPAs. However, the things have started improving this year with the bank earning a net profit of Rs. 6450 crore on revenues of Rs. 82,575 crore during the first half of the
						 current year. With the new government is determined to revive them economy and solve the problem of huge infrastructure loans, prospects for banks like SBI will improve considerably.

						 The quiet rise of a plastics processing company literally from the scratch to one of the topmost wealth generators for its shareholders is a fascinating story. This leading plastic proces-

						 fall in prices of PVC, the September 2014 quarter performance was a little disappointing. But this is a temporary phenomenon. The company's financial position is very strong with

						 There were widespread fears that Larsen and Toubro, the engineering colossus of India will suffer a sharp setback on account of the slump in crude oil prices, which in turn
						 could lead to a sharp slowdown in the infrastructure capex in the GCC region. However, although the orders from GCC region did slow down, L&T suffered no adverse impact as the flow of domestic orders swelled the order book of he
						 company.
					 </p>
					 <p align="left"><img src="<?php echo $baseUrl; ?>images/coverstory15.jpg" class="img-responsive" align="right"/> 
						 L&T could secure orders worth Rs. 63,400 crore in the first six months of the current fiscal, with domestic orders accounting for 74 per cent of orders  thanks to the
						 Modi government's resolve to give a big boost to infrastructure by solving the financial problems and speeding up clearances. Several new projects have been announced mainly in power, transportation and real estate sectors. Needless to
						 say, L&T will be one of the major beneficiaries of the new government's stress on infrastructure development.

						 A member of the prestigious south-based TVS group, TVS Srichakra is the number one manufacturer of twowheeler and three-wheeler tyres, enjoying a commendable 25
						 per cent market share. It is the largest supplier of tyres in the two-wheeler OEM segment and its major customers include all the major names in the industry viz. Honda Motor-
						 cycle, Scooters India, TVS Motor Company, Bajaj Auto, India Yamaha Motor, Hero MotoCorp, LML and Mahindra two-wheelers. Besides tyres for two- and three-wheelers, the company is also engaged in manufacture of industrial pneumatic
						 tyres, farm implement tyres, skid steer tyers, multipurpose tyres and floatation tyres where demand is limited but margins are high.

					 </p>
					 <p align="left"><img src="<?php echo $baseUrl; ?>images/coverstory16.jpg" class="img-responsive" align="right"/> 
						 As automobile industry in general and the two-wheeler sector in particular is doing quite well, the demand for tyres is rising. At the same time, prices of major raw materials are
						 declining. Natural rubber prices have turned distinctly bearish on account of bumper production in major rubber producing countries and synthetic rubber prices have plummeted
						 on account of a sharp slide in crude oil prices. So, the company has started growing at a fast pace on the financial front. During the last five years, its sales have more than
						 doubled from Rs. 706 crore in the fiscal 2010 to Rs. 1671 crore in the fiscal 2014 with the net profit moving up from Rs. 29.82 crore to Rs. 47.45 crore during this period. Thepace
						 of growth has quickened in the current year with the half-time turnover grossing Rs. 942 crore and the net profit shooting up to Rs. 43 crore - almost near the figure achieved in
						 the whole of the previous year. The company has huge reserves at around Rs. 200 crore - over 25 times its tiny equity capital of Rs. 7.66 crore. The company has been
						 paying handsome dividends, the rate for the last year being 160 per cent, but has not made any bonus issue. With high hopes of economic revival under the Modi government, prospects for this company are bound to im-
						 prove further. Realizing the remarkable scope for growth for this company, discernible investors have already started buying the stock, pushing up the price from Rs. 244 to over
						 Rs. 1585 within a year. We feel that there is a scope for further sharp appreciation. Accumulate at every decline.
