				 <h4>Reliance Capital</h4>
				 <h6>(BSE Code: 500111)</h6>
				 <p>
					 An equity analyst with a Mumbai-headquartered mutual fund favours Reliance Capital as a good buy in the wake of the acquisition of $58.4-million stake in this Anil
					 Ambani group company by Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank of Japan. According to the analyst, this association will strengthen the case of Reliance Capital for getting a licence
					 for setting up a bank with Sumitomo as a strategic partner. The stake sale has brightened the chances of Reliance Capital to be considered favourably for a banking licence. Again,
					 the company is doing well. In the September 2014 quarter, its revenues increased to Rs. 883 crore from Rs. 804 crore in the same quarter last year and the net profit has also
					 moved up from Rs. 62 crore to Rs. 68 crore. This is a good buy for a long term view, the analyst adds.

				 <h4>Minda Industries</h4>
				 <h6>(BSE Code: 532539)</h6>
				 <p>
					 A fund manager with an FII advises his friends and relatives to go long on Minda Industries. The flagship of the NK Minda group and engaged in the manufacture of a range of ancillaries
					 for 2-wheelers and 4-wheelers such as switches, censors, seat belts and wheel covers, is doing quite well. In the September 2014 quarter, the company has recorded
					 sales of Rs. 347 crore as compared to Rs. 273 crore in the corresponding quarter last year and its net profit has shot up nearly five times – from Rs. 5.12 crore to Rs. 25.50 crore. With rising earnings,
					 improving capacity utilization and postponement of capex, the company is steadily reducing its debt burden. Its debt-equity ratio came down from 2.11 in 2009 to 0.81 last year
					 and will go down further this year. Little wonder, ICRA, a rating agency has upgraded its long term rating from A- to A, and short term to A1, while maintaining a stable outlook.

				 <h4>GMM Pfaudler</h4>
				 <h6>(BSE Code: 505255)</h6>
				 <p>
					 The research division of a brokerage house is bullish on GMM Pfaudler, the Gujarat based company engaged in designing, manufacturing and marketing of glass-lined reactor
					 vessels, storage tanks, valves, pipe and fittings. Most of the equipments manufactured by GMM are used in chemical and pharmaceutical industries, both of which are on the
					 growth path. What is more, the company is doing very well in the current year if the actual half-time performance is any indication. During the April-September 2014 period, its sales
					 turnover has expanded by 17 per cent to Rs. 104.51 crore and the profit at net level zoomed by 63 per cent to Rs. 8.64 crore. The company’s financial position is very strong with
					 its book value standing at more than Rs. 80 per share of the face value of Rs. 2. After 2002 when it had issued bonus shares in the ratio of 1:2, the company has not made any bonus issue. It pays handsome dividends though, the rate
					 for the last year being 150 per cent.

				 <h4>Transport Corporation of India</h4>
				 <h6>(BSE Code: 532349)</h6>
				 <p>
					 A leading broker who has recently started his research bureau advises his clients to go for Transport Corporation of India, engaged in several segments of transportation and
					 logistics. The company is doing quite well in the current year also with actual half-time revenues crossing Rs. 1000crore mark at Rs. 1076 crore as against Rs. 977 crore in the
					 corresponding half-time last year and the net profit shooting up by around 40 per cent – from Rs. 27.10 crore to Rs. 37.36 crore. According to experts, the logistics business is
					 expected to grow at a rate of 20 per cent in the current as well as next year. What is more, the much talked about GST will also be a beneficial development for TCI.
					 The company’s financial position is very sound and its book value has crossed Rs. 80 per share of the face value of Rs. 2. The company has not made any bonus issue so far.

				 <h4>APL Apollo Tubes</h4>
				 <h6>(BSE Code: 533758)</h6>
				 <p>
					 An investment manager of a bank is buying APL Apollo Tubes, insisting that the outlook for the largest producer of electric resistance welded steel tubes in the country is very bright. The company manufactures black pipes, galvanized
				  	 tubes, pre-galvanized tubes and hollow sections with a total capacity of 8.4 lakh tonnes spread over six manufacturing plants located in UP, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Maharashtra. What is more, the company is growing from strength to
					 strength. In the first half (April to September 2014) of the current fiscal, it has grossed sales of Rs. 103 crore as compared to Rs. 88 crore in the corresponding period last year
					 and the profit at net level has shot up from Rs. 5.29 crore to Rs. 8.64 crore. Future prospects are all the more promising.

				 <h4>Star Paper</h4>
				 <h6>(BSE Code: 516022)</h6>
				 <p>
					 A couple of market operators have are said to have chalked out a kite flying plan to bid up the share price of Star Paper Mills, a UP-based integrated pulp and paper mill engaged in
					 the manufacture of cultural papers, maplitho and other paper products. Of course, the company is not doing well. During the last five years, while sales have remained stagnant around Rs.
					 260 crore, the company has been incurring losses year after year, the net loss being Rs. 42 crore for FY 2012, Rs. 30 crore for the next year and Rs. 22 crore for the last year. The only
					 positive sign is that the company has shown a nominal profit of Rs. 2.67 crore in the September 2014 quarter. Operators will shortly start spreading their ‘buy’ message through e-mails,
					 SMS and mouth-to-mouth publicity. Beware.
